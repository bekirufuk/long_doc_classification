# Experiments on Custom Transformers for Long Document Classification

[Hugging Face implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/src/transformers/models/longformer) of the Longformer [1] and Big Bird [2] models used for the initial classification experiments with a refined version of last 20 years of patent data from [Patentsview](https://patentsview.org/download/detail_desc_text).

Project currently includes experiments with different attention mapping approaches in the /src/finetune folder.
